# Server Identification Feature Demo

## Overview
Enhanced the front-page design to show which server each API comes from **without requiring hover**. Users can now immediately see the relationship between APIs and servers through visual indicators.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Server Legend on Page Cards**
Each page card now displays a "Connected Servers" section showing all servers used by that page:
- Color-coded server badges
- Consistent visual identity across the app
- Immediate visibility of page-server relationships

### 2. **Enhanced API Items**
Each API item now includes:
- **Left border color** matching the server color
- **Server badge** on the right side showing server name
- **Improved layout** with method, path, and server clearly visible

### 3. **Color-Coded Server Cards**
Server cards now have:
- **Matching left border** color with their APIs
- **Server ID badge** in the header
- **Consistent theming** across all components

### 4. **Server Color Scheme**
- **auth-server**: Blue (`bg-blue-500`)
- **payment-server**: Green (`bg-green-500`) 
- **user-server**: Purple (`bg-purple-500`)
- **analytics-server**: Orange (`bg-orange-500`)
- **notification-server**: Pink (`bg-pink-500`)
- **product-server**: Indigo (`bg-indigo-500`)
- **order-server**: Red (`bg-red-500`)

## Example: Login Page
The Login page uses APIs from multiple servers:
- **Auth Server**: POST /auth/login, GET /auth/validate, POST /auth/forgot-password
- **Payment Server**: GET /payment/status

### Visual Result:
1. **Server Legend**: Shows "Auth" (blue) and "Payment" (green) badges
2. **API Items**: 
   - Auth APIs have blue left borders and "Auth" badges
   - Payment API has green left border and "Payment" badge
3. **No Hover Required**: Everything is visible immediately
